# SLAG (Rust version)
SLAG is a bot for the Discord chat service. It was created for small guilds such as school clubs.

SLAG is an initialism of "Security, Logging, Analytics and General Purpose". The logo is based off from this, with the goal of the bot to be "solid as steel". 

Unlike many other bots, there are no donations, premium or voting.
